        <h2>Story</h2><br>

        You are a starship pilot tasked with fending off an eternal alien invasion. You've been given 3 hulls to achieve this mission, and if you lose all three there is always another pilot ready to take up arms.  <br><br>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <h2>Enemies</h2><br>

        There are six identified ships in the invading fleet. <br><br>

        <h3>Small Shuttle</h3>
        <img src="/assets/enemy1.png" alt="Enemy 1 Image" width="70" height="70">&emsp;
        <img src="/assets/enemy2.png" alt="Enemy 2 Image" width="70" height="70"><br>
        <h3>Mid-sized Shuttle</h3>
        <img src="/assets/enemy3.png" alt="Enemy 3 Image" width="70" height="70">&emsp;
        <img src="/assets/enemy4.png" alt="Enemy 4 Image" width="70" height="70">
        <br><br>
        The shuttle classes make up the majority of the alien forces. Fortunately, they don't appear to be armed, though they often travel in large groups. Be careful not to crash into them, and take out as many you can without risking your ship.<br><br>

        <h3>Destroyer</h3>
        <img src="/assets/boss1.png" alt="Boss 1 Image" width="80" height="120">&emsp;
        <img src="/assets/boss2.png" alt="Boss 1 Image" width="80" height="120">
        <br><br>
        Destroyers are rare, but dangerous. Unlike shuttles, they are armed with laser-cannons, and will return fire. Once you find one, they'll stick with you, unlike shuttles. <br><br>
        We've updated your HUD to ignore passing space debris and stars while you are engaged in battle with a destroyer; this should help you identify and dodge their attacks. We've also identified key components of their hull-integrity; we'll display the estimated remaining damage a destroyer can handle before being defeated. 
        <br><br>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2><br>
        We've included a time-travel device in your ships. Don't get too excited; it doesn't let you go backward in time. What it will do is freeze time; press the "B" button on your controls to engage the time-freeze device, then "A" to unfreeze time.
